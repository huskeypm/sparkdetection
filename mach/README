### PNP project 
To generate roc data:
python optimer.py -optimize3
(double check, should just do this from figs.py) 

python figs.py -paperfigs # generate figures for paper
python figs.py -rocfigs # generate roc figures (after running optimizer.py) 



--- misc 
MACH.ipynb has validation routines written inside 
fig3.py is currently optimized for scale, fusedThresh,bulkTresh
