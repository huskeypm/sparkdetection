MACH.ipynb has validation routines written inside 


fig3.py is currently optimized for scale, fusedThresh,bulkTresh
-- need to extrapolate results 

optimize::Assess
  TestParams (both thresh, scale, inv) 
    bankDetect::TestFilters(both thresh, scale, inv)
      bankDetect::DetectFilter (fused,scale)
      bankDetect::DetectFilter (fused,scale)
-- add new false/true positive images 
  I think they are OK 
-- add scale as an optimizable variable 
  Not easy to test
