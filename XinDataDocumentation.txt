This is a file to describe the observations that Dylan made on 8/27/2018 on Xin's data (from Bill Louch's Lab).
This dataset is for spark detection. Xin wishes to classify :
	1. Spark amplitude
	2. FWHM - axial full width at half-maximum
	3. FDHM - lateral full width at half-maximum
	4. Time to peak amplitude (This would be the easiest overall to classify)

Data is located at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SZWcBYGxgdf6sQ5hETSBTNh9lYrDA_vO

Really promising data in folder:
./new/16.lsm - good SNR and lots of sparks
./new/17.lsm - promising!

Alright data:
./new/5.lsm - 2 decently strong sparks
./new/6.lsm - couple of OKAY sparks
./new/9.lsm - 2 very slow Ca transients (sparks or not?)
./new/10.lsm - 1 spark
./new/13.lsm - lots of small sparks
./new/14.lsm - high noise amplitude but lots of sparks
./new/15.lsm - no sparks but observable increase in globabl fluorescent intensity across time
./new/18.lsm - strong Ca waves
./new/20.lsm - Alright. A few good Ca sparks
./new/21.lsm - OKAY
./14.lsm - A couple of good sparks
./6.lsm - Ca wave

Challenging Data:
./new/1.lsm
./new/2.lsm
./new/3.lsm
./new/4.lsm
./new/7.lsm
./new/8.lsm
./new/11.lsm
./new/12.lsm
./new/19.lsm
./new/20.lsm
./new/21.lsm
./16.lsm
./10.lsm
./13.lsm
./2.lsm

Ideas for classification:
 - use a moving spatiotemporal average (3D cuboid filter) of maybe 3-5 frames and 3px x 3px and subtract that out from each image, we could begin to attenuate the noise.
